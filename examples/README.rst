Examples
========

Each example includes two folders, ``before/`` which is what the directory looks
like before running staticjinja, and ``after/``, which is what it should look
like afterwards.

The entry point for each of the included examples is the shell script
``build.sh``. This may either use ``staticjinja`` from the CLI directly, or it
may use a ``build.py`` script for more complicated builds.
